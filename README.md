Situation Assessment :
	I learned a lot with this project, but still there are some problems in the application part, I think I can solve many problems in 1-2 weeks. I rewrote my code because it had become unmaintainable because I didn't have enough knowledge when start. I think, it was a serious disadvantage for me to start learning Unity with 2D but i'm trying to close the gap.
